# QUICK NOTE:
Xina520 is not responsible for any damages that encounter on your device.

If you choose to jailbreak using XinaA15, **YOU** are the person who is responsible with any damages that encounter on your device.

Please take the proper precautions below.

# AS USUAL, CHECK IF YOUR DEVICE IS SUPPORTED
If you don't check this, you are more likely to run into issues or even break your device.
Please check the [supported devices](https://github.com/NotDarkn/XinaA15/blob/main/SUPPORTED.md) list before doing anything.

# BE WARNED, THIS IS A IN-DEVELOPMENT JAILBREAK.

This jailbreak is **IN-DEVELOPMENT** and was **NOT** made for normal public use, and because of that you **WILL** encounter issues at some point.

Not only that, but this jailbreak is a **rootless jailbreak.** Due to the rootless environments that were needed for XinaA15, many tweaks will be unsupported and will need an update to support rootless. If you install an untrusted, ancient (not updated), unsupported, or root-only tweak, you may encounter any of the issues below.

**Issues that COULD occur if used incorrectly:**
- [**Device bootlooping**](https://ios.cfw.guide/troubleshooting/#bootloops) → A forever-booting Apple logo.
- [**Respring looping**](https://ios.cfw.guide/troubleshooting/#respring-loops) → A forever-loading spring icon.
- [**Corrupted data**](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204184) → Forever lost data, photos, documents, and more.

**Please make sure to take the following precautions to prevent any damage on your iPhone device:**
- [**Backup your device.**](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203977) → You can use iTunes on Windows or Finder on macOS to backup your phone.
- [**Save blobs for your device.**](https://ios.cfw.guide/saving-blobs/) → Saving blobs will allow you to downgrade back to a iOS version when needed.
- [**Do not install any dangerous tweaks.**](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73033672/211621673-bdaaec4b-9b8e-43e2-8d00-0c2fec1c962c.png) → Downloading dangerous tweaks / stuff from piracy repos may endanger your phone.

All in all, **just use your common sense.**
