1. Install TrollStore from opa334's GitHub, installation instructions & info can be found there too: [**opa334/TrollStore**](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore)

2. After installing TrollStore, download the XinaA15 IPA from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/jacksight/xina520_official_jailbreak/releases)

3. Once downloaded, open the IPA with TrollStore and install the IPA.

4. After the IPA is installed, go to TrollStore settings and tap **Install idid**, this is required to open the XinaA15 app.

5. Once it's installed, open the XinaA15 app.

6. Tap `openJailbreak` to start installing the XinaA15 jailbreak.

7. Your device will most likely reboot, you may want to check the XinaA15 app again to make sure it says "Currently in jailbreak state". If it doesn't, try again, it may take a second try.

8. Once it states that XinaA15 is "Currently in jailbreak state", make sure to install the Sileo: Xina Beta IPA's through TrollStore from here: [Sileo: Xina Beta](https://github.com/Sileo/Sileo/releases)

9. After Sileo is installed, you should be ready to install tweaks and use XinaA15. Congratulations.

# Extras after installation
